VACUUM FULL - > JUST LIKE MOVE COMMAND IN ORACLE . IT TAKES MORE TIME, 
     BUT IT RETURNS THE SPACE TO OS BECAUSE OF ITS COMPLEX ALGORITHM. 
     IT also requires additional disk space , which can store the new copy of the table., 
     until the activity is completed. Also it locks the table exclusively, 
     which block all operations on the table .

-- Command to run vacuum full command for table:

psqldb=# VACUUM FULL pdbtest.emptab;
VACUUM

DEMO TO CHECK HOW IT RECLAIMS SPACE:

-- Check existing space and delete some data:
psqldb=# select pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('pdbtest.emptab'));
pg_size_pretty
----------------
114 MB
(1 row)

psqldb=# delete from pdbtest.emptab where oid=13634;
DELETE 131072

-- We can observe size is still same:

psqldb=# select pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('pdbtest.emptab'));
pg_size_pretty
----------------
114 MB
(1 row)

-- Run vacuum full and observe the space usage:

psqldb=# VACUUM FULL pdbtest.emptab;
VACUUM

psqldb=# select pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('pdbtest.emptab'));
pg_size_pretty
----------------
39 MB ---- > from 114MB it came down to 39 MB.
(1 row)
