how to clone a  POSTGRES database to remote server.

source postgres details:

host      -> dbaclass-local
db_name   -> dbatest — > This database need to be migrated.
port      -> 5444
superuser -> enterprisedb

remote postgres server details:
host       -> dbaclass-remote
port       -> 5444
superuser  -> enterprisedb
exiting_db -> postgres

1. Test whether you are able to connect from local to remote existing database.[on local]
$ psql --host dbaclass-remote -p 5444 -d postgres

postgres=# \conninfo
You are connected to database "postgres" as user "enterprisedb" on host "dbaclass-remote" at port "5444".
postgres=#

postgres=# \list

2. Check the objects present in local postgres db:[ON LOCAL]

yourdb=# \dt

3. Now run the clone script using pg_dump command:[RUN ON LOCAL SERVER]

syntax – > pg_dump -C -d database – U username | psql -h remotehost -U username -d remote_database

Here remote_database is an existing database in the remote postgres cluster, so that this command can connect to an existing database and run the create database command.
$ pg_dump -C -d dbatest -U enterprisedb | psql -h dbaclass-remote -U enterprisedb -d postgres

4. Check whether the database and its objects were replicated or not:[ on remote server]
=# \list
=# \dt

We can see the database and its objects were created in the remote machine.
